# WebScraper
Early version of an image webscraper manga  
Currently supports mangadex and bato

I recommend using MangaDex for downloads over Bato, since MangaDex *should* be faster. 

Notes: Manga folders and images will be placed in the current working directory   
Downloaded in png format.

Only use this tool on manga you have the rights to. Don't re-upload anything this script downloads.   
This was built as a learning exercise, and I am not responsible for any legal problems you get into.  
# Use at your own risk.
